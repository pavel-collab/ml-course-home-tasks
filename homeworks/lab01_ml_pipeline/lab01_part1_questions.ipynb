    "Which of the following statements about $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$-NN) are true in a classification setting, and for all $k$? Select all that apply.\n",
    "1. The decision boundary (hyperplane between classes in feature space) of the k-NN classifier is linear.\n",
    "2. The training error of a 1-NN will always be lower than that of 5-NN.\n",
    "3. The test error of a 1-NN will always be lower than that of a 5-NN.\n",
    "4. The time needed to classify a test example with the k-NN classifier grows with the size of the training set.\n",
    "5. None of the above.\n",

    "1. False. The decision boundary only locally is linear, but in general has comlex shape\n",
    "\n",
    "2. False. Training error for 1-NN is 0 since every sample will choose itself. Although error for 5-NN is almost always greater than 0, it can reach exactly 0. Simple example - two distant clusters for data points. This way 5-NN training error is zero\n",
    "\n",
    "3. False. Simple example: $x_{\\text{train}} = [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 3]$ and $y_{\\text{train}} = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]$. If we intoduce test point $x = 2$ with $y = 0$ then for 1-NN test error is 1 and for 5-NN is 0\n",
    "\n",
    "4. True. Yes, it is correct since for every test sample kNN has to go through all train points\n",
